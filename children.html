                <p>If you&#8217;re between the ages of 4 and 11, then KidZone is the place to be. After meeting in the Community hall, we join the adults in the main Church for the first few minutes of the service, which is aimed towards the younger age group. We spend the rest of the time back in the Community hall where we have stories, games, songs, crafts, and sometimes sweets! It’s a great time to meet your friends and learn about the Bible in an exciting way!</p>
