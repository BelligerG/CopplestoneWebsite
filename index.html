                <p>Copplestone Methodist Church is in the centre of the mid&#8210;Devon village of Copplestone and at the heart of the community. We welcome families, youth and adults of all ages. We want you to feel at home here.</p>
                
                <p>Church doesn&#8217;t have to be boring. <b>The message about Jesus is good news</b> and as relevant today as it&#8217;s ever been. We want people to discover just how amazing Jesus is and what a difference he makes to life.</p>
                
                <p>Our services are relaxed and informal, the music is up-to-date, the teaching is relevant to our everyday lives and Jesus is always the focus! So why not come along?</p>
                
                <h2>Service Times</h2>
                
                <p>We have two Sunday services every week. Our main service is on <b>Sunday morning at 10:45am</b>, with Coffee served from 10:15am. Children and young people join the adults for the first part of the service and then have their own Youth Church activities: Kidzone for the 4 &#8210; 10s and then for those aged 11 &#8210; 16 we have The Grid. There&#8217;s also a cr&#232;che for 3 year olds and under.</p>
                
                <p>On Sunday evenings at 6:15pm we hold a second service which is mainly a more traditional style service, but we also hold film evenings, youth services, one off events and much more during this time, to where all ages are welcomed.</p>
                
                <h2>What to wear?</h2>
                
                <p>Whatever you like! Just be yourself, people at Copplestone have a whole variety of style, from jeans and T-shirt to Sunday best. We think it's more important for you to feel comfortable than to adhere to a dress code.</p>
                
                <h2>What about my Additional Needs?</h2>

                    <li>Through prayer, worship and Bible&#8210;based learning together, we seek to be Christ-centred people, led by God&#8217;s Spirit, committed to growth and equipped for mission and service.</li>
