                    <p>Dear Friends,</p>

                    <p>As you know, church buildings up and down the country, inclusing ours here in Copplestone, have been closed in recent weeks in light of the ongoing response to 
                        COVID-19. We've been unable to meet together in person on Sundays for our usual services and all kinds of midweek groups haven't been able to meet in or use the 
                        building.
                    </p>
