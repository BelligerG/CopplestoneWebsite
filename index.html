                <p>Copplestone Methodist Church is in the centre of the mid&#8210;Devon village of Copplestone and at the heart of the community. We welcome families, youth and adults of all ages. We want you to feel at home here.</p>
                
                <p>Church doesn&#8217;t have to be boring. <b>The message about Jesus is good news</b> and as relevant today as it’s ever been. We want people to discover just how amazing Jesus is and what a difference he makes to life.</p>
                
                <p>Our services are relaxed and informal, the music is up-to-date, the teaching is relevant to our everyday lives and Jesus is always the focus! So why not come along?</p>
                
                <h2>Service Times</h2>
                
                <p>We have two Sunday services every week. Our main service is on <b>Sunday morning at 10:45am</b>, with Coffee served from 10:15am. Children and young people join the adults for the first part of the service and then have their own Youth Church activities: Kidzone for the 4 &#8210; 10s and then for those aged 11 &#8210; 16 we have The Grid. There’s also a cr&#232;che for 3 year olds and under.</p>
                
                <p>On Sunday evenings at 6:15pm we hold a second service which is mainly a more traditional style service, but we also hold film evening, youth services, one off events and much more during this time, to where all ages are welcomed. See our whats on page for details.</p>
