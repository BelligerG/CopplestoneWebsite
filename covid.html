                <p>A letter from the leaders:</p>

                <p>Greetings in Jesus&#8217; Name to all who are a part of our very special church family.
                    Like you, we all miss sharing worship and fellowship together on a Sunday. 
                    We are deeply grateful to Chris Sampson for his enthusiasm, expertise and time commitment enabling us to have an online service every Sunday. 
                    Thank you Chris! </p>

                <p>You may be wondering when we will return to using our building again on a Sunday, particularly in light of the Government saying that from 4th 
                    July places of worship can begin opening. However, it is not straightforward ! There are many conditions to satisfy and restrictions on what we can do 
                    and how we can do it! We have a responsibility to keep everyone safe.
                </p>

                <p>Currently we are waiting for guidance both from the Government and from the Methodist Church, under whose authority we come, to know what options are 
                    available to us for re- commencing Sunday worship in the building for all our church family - adults and children. When the information is available 
                    we will be calling, via this notice sheet, a Zoom Church Council Meeting as that body has the authority to decide when and how we reopen..</p>

                <p>Meanwhile, be assured that our on-line Sunday worship will continue for as long as necessary.</p>

                <p>God bless you all.</p>
