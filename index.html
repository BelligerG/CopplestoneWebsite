                <p>It is with great sadness that in line with Government and UK Methodist Church advice we are suspending all church services and other gatherings with immediate effect until further notice. We will update you as and when the situation changes. Below are links to a pastoral letter from John and the circuit leadership team and links to alternative services and resources to help during this time.</p>

                <p>You may have heard on the news that anyone with symptoms of a new persistent cough or termperature should self&#8210;isolate due to the corona virus.  It has also been said that the older generation are at higher risk of complications if they contract the virus.</p>
                
                <p>If you or someone you know are self&#8210;isolating or do not want to risk going outside and need help with anything from food shopping to dog walking. Please get in touch with Councillor Stuart Penny on the following number <b>07890284871</b> and he will arrange help or support as needed either by himself or some local volunteers.</p>
                
                <p><b>Kind Regards</b></p>

                <p>Copplestone Methodist Church is in the centre of the mid&#8210;Devon village of Copplestone and at the heart of the community. We welcome families, youth and adults of all ages. We want you to feel at home here.</p>
                
                <p>Church doesn&#8217;t have to be boring. <b>The message about Jesus is good news</b> and as relevant today as it&#8217;s ever been. We want people to discover just how amazing Jesus is and what a difference he makes to life.</p>
                
                <p>Our services are relaxed and informal, the music is up-to-date, the teaching is relevant to our everyday lives and Jesus is always the focus! So why not come along?</p>
                
                <h2>Service Times</h2>
                
                <p>We have two Sunday services every week. Our main service is on <b>Sunday morning at 10:45am</b>, with Coffee served from 10:15am. Children and young people join the adults for the first part of the service and then have their own Youth Church activities: Kidzone for the 4 &#8210; 10s and then for those aged 11 &#8210; 16 we have The Grid. There&#8217;s also a cr&#232;che for 3 year olds and under.</p>
                
                <p>On Sunday evenings at 6:15pm we hold a second service which is mainly a more traditional style service, but we also hold film evenings, youth services, one off events and much more during this time, to where all ages are welcomed.</p>
