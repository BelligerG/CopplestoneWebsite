                <p>The Grid is for you if you are between 11 and 16. With the rest of the Youth Church we join the adults in the main Church for the first few minutes of the service, and then we meet upstairs. The Grid is a great way to get involved in our exciting Sunday programme, and gives you a chance to meet people your own age, study the Bible and relate it to real life issues.</p>
